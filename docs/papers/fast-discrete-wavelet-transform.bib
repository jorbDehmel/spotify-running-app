abstract="The Fast Wavelet Transform (FWT) algorithm is the basic tool for computation with wavelets. The forward transform converts a signal representation from the time (spatial) domain to its representation in the wavelet basis. Conversely, the inverse transform reconstructs the signal from its wavelet representation back to theÂ time (spatial) domain. These two operations need to be performed for analysis and synthesis of every signal that is processed in wavelet applications. For this reason, it is crucial that the Wavelet Transform can be implemented very efficiently.",
